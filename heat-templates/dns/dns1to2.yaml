  Showcase how to replace Designate v1 resources with v2 ones.
  Unfortunately this does not work w/o downtime, as the v1 resources
  must be deleted and re-created as v2 ones.
  0. Create this stack (works only on Pike with designate v1 api enabled)
  1. Comment out designate v1 resources (domain, record[1-3])
  2. Update stack
  3. Uncomment designate v2 resources (zone, recordset*)
  4. Update stack

resources:
  test:
    type: OS::Heat::TestResource

  domain:
    type: OS::Designate::Domain
    properties:
      email: foo@bar.net
      name: bar.net.

  record1:
    type: OS::Designate::Record
    properties:
      domain: { get_resource: domain }
      name: baz.bar.net.
      type: A
      data: 10.20.30.41

  record2:
    type: OS::Designate::Record
    properties:
      domain: { get_resource: domain }
      name: baz.bar.net.
      type: A
      data: 10.20.30.42

  record3:
    type: OS::Designate::Record
    properties:
      domain: { get_resource: domain }
      name: zzz.bar.net.
      type: A
      data: 10.20.30.50

# 'zone' resource replaces 'domain' resource above
# 'recordset1_2' replaces 'record1' and 'record2' as they fall into the same recordset
# 'recordset3' replaces 'record3', it has different name than 'record1' and 'record2'
# so falls into a separate recordset

  #zone:
  #  type: OS::Designate::Zone
  #  properties:
  #    email: foo@bar.net
  #    name: bar.net.

  #recordset1_2:
  #  type: OS::Designate::RecordSet
  #  properties:
  #    zone: { get_resource: zone}
  #    name: baz.bar.net.
  #    type: A
  #    records:
  #      - 10.20.30.41
  #      - 10.20.30.42

  #recordset3:
  #  type: OS::Designate::RecordSet
  #  properties:
